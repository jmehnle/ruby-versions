# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)
#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 6 (UNRELEASED)

  * Minor improvements.

--- 5 (2013-05-20 23:35)

  * Change shim path to /var/lib/ruby-versions/bin (was: /usr/local/lib/
    ruby-versions/bin).
  * Makefile: improve path handling, add DESTDIR support, do not fail removing
    missing files.

--- 4 (2013-05-16 23:50)

  * Fix double definition of RUBY_VERSIONS_VERSION.  Duh.
  * Make "install" make target depend on "all" target, so an explicit
    `make all` isn't required.
  * Update MANIFEST (add CHANGES, remove debian/).

--- 3 (2013-05-15 21:40)

  + Add --is-ruby-versions command-line option for testing whether a shimmable
    command (such as `ruby` or `bundle`) is in fact a ruby-versions shim.
    ruby-versions returns a 0 exit code, whereas real commands will return a
    non-0 exit code.  (You will want to redirect STDERR to /dev/null.)
  * Improve platform portability by not relying on arbitrary shebang line in
    ruby-versions.  Instead, during installation invoke via any locally
    available `ruby`, and change shebang line of script being installed to a
    real `ruby`.
  * Minor clean-up of installation logic.

--- 2 (2013-05-14 19:15)

  * Fix issues when running ruby-versions itself under Ruby 1.9.

--- 1 (2013-05-13 22:55)

  * Auto-detect version of Ruby interpreters with unversioned names (such as
    "ruby") rather than assuming they are 1.8.
